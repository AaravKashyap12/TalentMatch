**TalentMatch** is an advanced, AI-powered resume screening and ranking system designed specifically for the nuances of **Computer Science and Engineering** recruitment. 

Unlike generic keyword counters, TalentMatch uses a robust NLP pipeline to understand technical context, measure experience accurately, and allow recruiters to fine-tune ranking priorities based on the specific role (e.g., prioritizing "Skills" over "Education" for a Senior Dev role).

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Parsing
- **Universal CS Role Support**: tuned for specific terminologies in Software Engineering, Data Science, Cybersecurity, DevOps, QA, and Research.
- **Section-Aware Extraction**: Smartly distinguishes between "Work Experience" and "Projects" or "Hobbies" to prevent false positives.
- **Natural Date Understanding**: Parses complex date formats ("Jan 2020 - Current", "2018-2022") and textual durations ("five years experience").

### ⚖️ Weighted Ranking Engine
- **Recruiter Control**: Interactive sliders (Ignore/Low/Medium/High/Critical) to adjust the weight of:
    - 🧠 **Skills Match**: Overlap with critical job keywords.
    - � **Experience**: Total years of relevant professional history.
    - 🎓 **Education**: Academic background relevance.
    - 📝 **Content Similarity**: Semantic text similarity score.
- **Normalized Scoring**: A proprietary scoring algorithm ensures a balanced 0-100% match score regardless of weight configuration.

### �️ Instant Resume Preview
- **Interactive Results**: Click on any candidate in the ranking table to instantly render their original PDF resume within the application.
- **No Downloads Needed**: Screen candidates efficiently without cluttering your downloads folder.

### 📊 Visual Analytics
- **Interactive Charts**: Compare top candidates side-by-side using dynamic Plotly bar charts.
